# Walmart sales analysis
created a Power BI dashboard on Walmart sales to show the performance of products by its categories in 2013 and 2014.
we have downloaded this data source from an open-source project where we have changed the name and a few changes in column metrics.
created a few quick Dax measurers to calculate the sales of 2013 and 2014 by month and created a new month table from the date column by using the power query editor.
This dashboard report contains a line chart, a bar chart to show the sales by country and month of 2013 and 2014 also slicers to filter categories and countries, while a table has been created to show the top 3 products in each segment by its profit.
